            <h3> WEB DEVELOPMENT AS AN INDUSTRY</h3>
            <p>Examples of dramatic transformation in communication and commerce led by web development include e-commerce. Online auction sites such as eBay have changed the way consumers find and purchase goods and services. Online retailers such as Amazon.com
                and Buy.com (among many others) have transformed the shopping and bargain-hunting experience for many consumers.

            <h3>PRACTICAL WEB DEVELOPMENT</h3>
            <p>Since the commercialization of the web, web development has been a growing industry. The growth of this industry is being driven by businesses wishing to use their website to advertise and sell products and services to customers.
            </p>

            <p>There are many open source tools for web development such as BerkeleyDB, GlassFish, LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and Perl/Plack. This has kept the cost of learning web development to a minimum. Another contributing factor to the
                growth of the industry has been the rise of easy-to-use WYSIWYG web-development software, such as Adobe Dreamweaver, BlueGriffon and Microsoft Visual Studio. Knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML) or of programming languages is
                still required to use such software, but the basics can be learned and implemented quickly.
            </p>

            <p>An ever-growing set of tools and technologies have helped developers build more dynamic and interactive websites. Further, web developers now help to deliver applications as web services which were traditionally only available as applications
                on a desk-based computer. This has allowed for many opportunities to decentralize information and media distribution. Examples can be seen with the rise of cloud services such as Adobe Creative Cloud, Dropbox and Google Drive. These web
                services allow users to interact with applications from many locations, instead of being tied to a specific workstation for their application environment.
